OWASAP
The OWASAP ( Open Web Application Security Project)  TOP 10  is a standard awareness document for developer and web application security. It represents a board consensus about the most critical security risk to web application
The 8 key risks
i. Broken acess control
ii. cryptographic failure
iii. injection(SQLiject, XSS)
iv. Insecure Design
v. vulnerable and outdated component
vi. server side request forgivery
vii. Security misconfiguration
vii. identification and authorization failure

The web security maintainace is a layered apporoach including rigours authentication, data verification, secure session management and comprehensive auditing to mitigate vulnerabilities and ensure confidentiality, intergrity and avaialbility
1. strong authentication
ii. strict authorization
iii. input validation
iv. data protection in transit
v. secure session management
vi proper error handling
vii. auditing and logging
viii output encoding

Broken Access control occurs when user can act outside their intened permission leading to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction of data.
i.IDOR
ii.privilege escalation
iii.missing function level acess control
iv.cors misconfiguration
v. metadata manipulation

Various failure
cryptographic failure
identification and authentication failure
software and data integrity failure
security loggin and monitoring failure

type of injection
i.XSS injection
ii. command injection
iii. LDAP injection
iv. XML injection
v. Server side template injection

Server side request forgivery is an attack where the attack request the server side application to make a request to an unintended location, often to access internal resource behind a firewall.
i. input validation
ii. whitelisting
iii. firewall Rules
iv. use of safe API
v. Least privilage
