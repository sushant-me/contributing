What is Cloud Security?
ans: Cloud security is a set of polices, technologies, control and design procedure to protect cloud-based system, data and infrastructure from external and internal threat.

Cloud security Threats:
i. data breches
ii. data loss
iii. account hijacking
iv. denial of service
v. insecure APIs
vi. malicious Insider
vii. abuse of cloud services
viii. shared technology issue

What is Security as Service?
ans: Security as Service is a cloud delivery model where third party provider integrate their security services into your infrastructure on a subscription basis. It allows organiation to outsource the management of security tools rather than maintaining the  m on- premises.
Example
Identity and Access management (IAM)
Data Loss and prevention (DLP)
Web security
email security

Benefit:
cost effective
constant update
experties

Dimention of security is achibved by CIA traid which mean confendentality, integraity and avaliability 
but to achive these CIA triad we need to keep these in mind:
i. data security
ii. indentity and access management
iii. application security
iv. network security
v. infrastrcutre security
vi. endpoint security 
vii. physcial security

Cloud security mechanism is a specific technical control, software tool or process to implemented to enfroce security polices and protect cloud resource
i. SOS( single sign on)
ii. IAM( Identity and access management)
iii. Hashing
iv. Digital signature

Distater recovery is a polices, tool or procedure to enable the recovery or continuation of vital technology infrastructure and system following a natural or human-intended disaster.
Key
i. RTO( Recovery time objective)
ii. RPO ( Recovery point object)
iii. Geo-Redundancy
iv. Backup-stragegy
v. fail over mechanism
vi. disaster recovery as a service

Challenges in Cloud Security
i. lack of visibility and control
ii. data soverinity and complicance
iii. Shared technology issue
iv. Insecure API
v. Insider threat
vi. Account Hijacking
