Web security approaches are classifiend by TCP/IP stack where security services sre applied: Network Level(IPSec), Transport Level ( SSL/TLS) or Application Level (S/MIMS,PGP)
3 Approaches are:
i. Network level
ii. Transport level
iii. Application Level

SSL architecture
1.IP
2. TCP
3. SSL recorder protocol
4. SSL handshake protocol
5. SSL cipher change spec
6. SSL Alert protocol
7. HTTP

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure, encrypted communication over a computer network, most notably the internet. 
Phase 1: etablish capabilities
Phase 2: Sever Authentication
Phase 3:Cliet Authentication and key exchange
Phase 4: finish

IPSec is a suit of protocol that provides security services at IP layer( network layer 3). It secures all traffic passing through the network , transparent to application using authentication header (ah) and encapsulating security playload (ESP)
IPSec type
IPSec transport mode
IPSec tunnel mode

Pretty good privacy                                          Secure/MIME
trust: web of trust                                          Centralized authority
key use: personal security                                   coperate Security
integration : often require a seperate plugin                build-in outlook
content type: handel text well                                espically for multimedia
algorithm: uses own unique key                                X.509 Certificate
cost: Usally free                                             certificate usually cost money
