What is cloud computing?
ans: Cloud computing is on demand acess to shared computing resources over the internet. It allows you to rapidly scale your resources up or down without needing to buy physcial hardware.

Need of cloud computing 
i. Cost saving(CapEx to OpEx)
ii. Scalability and elasticity
iii. Focus on your bussiness
iv. Disaster recovery

What is cloud computing by NIST?
NIST(National Institute of Standard and Technology defines the cloud computing as : " cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous , convenient , on-demand network access to a share pool of configurable computing resources, that can rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort.
