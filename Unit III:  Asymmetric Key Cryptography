Public key crptography resove the key distribution problem of symmetric Encryption by using a pair of key: a public key for encryption (distrubuted to anyone ) and a private key for decryption (kept secret by owner).

RSA algorithm
Phase 1: Key generation
i. select two prime number
ii. calculate n = p*q
iii. calculate euler totient
iv. select public key
v. calculate private key

Phase 2: Encryption
C =m^e (mod o/ n)

Phase 3: Decryption
M = C^d (mod n)

3 asymetric 
i. Diffie-Hellman key exchange
ii. ElGamal Encryption
iii. Ellictive  Curve Cryptography
